# OCR-Based Provisional Diagnosis Extraction

This project extracts text from medical images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), processes the extracted text to find provisional diagnoses, and saves the results to a CSV file.

## How to run the code:
1 Save the script as main.py. </br>
2  Run the script using the updated file path:
Keep the path ready </br>

On macOS or Linux: </br>

python main.py /Users/bhaveshreddy/Downloads/PS2-Samples-HackRX/Sample5.png       

</br>
On Windows (using Command Prompt or PowerShell): </br>

python main.py "C:\Users\bhaveshreddy\Downloads\PS2-Samples-HackRX\Sample5.png" </br>

Output would be in the same path , file name provisional_diagnoses.csv  </br>
